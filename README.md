# OpenStudioMeasures

This my personal github repository for the OpenStudio Measures I create.

So far I have added:

* Add PSZ-HP to All Zones: this is my most advanced measure so far
	* Need to add description
* Add Fully defined Daylighting Sensor
* Enable DCV and switch central Constant Volume Fan to Variable Volume Fan (VFD)
* Purge Unused Design Specification Outdoor Air
    * with an optional string filter: only applies to DSOAs where name includes the specified string
* Append Suffix to Thermal Zone Name
	* User can specify if affect thermal zones should either INCLUDE or NOT INCLUDE the searched string
